# Day 2 Notes – Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)



# 1. What is SDLC?

**SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)** is a standard process followed by software companies to:

* Design software
* Develop software
* Test software
* Deliver a high-quality product to customers

Every organization follows SDLC, including:

* Startups
* MNCs
* Product companies
* E-commerce companies

---

# 2. Why is SDLC Important?

SDLC helps organizations:

* Deliver high-quality products
* Meet customer expectations
* Reduce defects and bugs
* Follow a standardized development process
* Improve collaboration between teams

Without proper testing and planning, software quality decreases.

# 3. Main Phases of SDLC

```text
Planning
    ↓
Defining Requirements
    ↓
Design
    ↓
Build (Development)
    ↓
Testing
    ↓
Deployment
    ↓
Repeat for new features
```

SDLC is a continuous cycle.

---

# 4. Planning Phase

## Purpose

Gather business requirements and customer feedback.

## Activities

* Market research
* Customer surveys
* Requirement gathering
* Feature feasibility analysis


---

# 5. Requirement Definition Phase

After collecting data, requirements are documented.

## Output

### SRS Document

**SRS = Software Requirement Specification**

Contains:

* Customer requirements
* Business requirements
* Feature details
* Collected research data

This document becomes the reference for developers and designers.

---

# 6. Design Phase

The design phase converts requirements into a technical solution.

There are two major design levels:

## A. High-Level Design (HLD)

Prepared by:

* Architects
* Technical Leads
* Senior Engineers

### Includes

* System architecture
* Scalability requirements
* High availability requirements
* Database selection
* Application deployment strategy

### Example

* Application must handle increased traffic during Christmas.
* Application should be scalable.
* Multiple application replicas should be available.

---

## B. Low-Level Design (LLD)

Prepared by:

* Senior Developers
* Technical Leads

### Includes

* Functions
* Modules
* APIs
* Database calls
* Parameters and responses
* Programming logic

### Example

* Use MySQL database
* Function inputs and outputs
* Module interactions

---

# 7. Build (Development) Phase

## Purpose

Convert designs into actual code.

## Activities

Developers:

1. Read requirements
2. Read design documents
3. Write code
4. Review code with peers
5. Push code to a source code repository

### Source Code Repository

Commonly used:

* Git

Purpose:

* Centralized code storage
* Team collaboration
* Version control

---

# 8. Testing Phase

## Purpose

Verify software quality.

A developer saying:

> "It works on my machine"

is not enough.

Software must be tested independently.

### Process

1. Code is deployed to a test environment.
2. QA/QE engineers validate functionality.
3. Bugs are reported and fixed.

### QA/QE Team

**Quality Assurance Engineers**

Responsibilities:

* Functional testing
* Validation
* Quality checks

---

# 9. Deployment Phase

## Purpose

Release tested software to production.

### Process

Development
      ↓
Testing Environment
      ↓
Production Environment
      ↓
Customers


Customers interact only with the production version.

---

# 10. Where Does DevOps Fit In?

DevOps focuses primarily on:

1. Build
2. Test
3. Deployment

These are the most important SDLC phases from a DevOps perspective.

---

# 11. Role of a DevOps Engineer

A DevOps engineer:

* Does not manually develop software
* Does not manually test software
* Does not manually deploy software

Instead, they:

* Automate processes
* Improve efficiency
* Reduce manual intervention
* Speed up software delivery

---

# 12. DevOps Goal


Automation
      ↓
Faster Delivery
      ↓
Higher Efficiency
      ↓
Better Product Quality


The primary responsibility is automating:

* Build processes
* Testing processes
* Deployment processes

---

# 13. Important DevOps Mindset

Whenever learning a tool such as:

* Terraform
* Ansible
* Jenkins
* Docker
* Kubernetes

Ask:

> How can this improve my organization's efficiency?

Not every popular tool is suitable for every organization.

A DevOps engineer must choose tools based on organizational needs.

---

# 14. SDLC Models Mentioned

Different project management approaches exist:

* Waterfall Model
* Iterative Model
* Agile Model

### Most Common Today

**Agile Methodology**

Characteristics:

* Small chunks of work
* Short sprints
* Faster delivery
* Continuous improvement

Instead of waiting for the entire project to finish, teams deliver features incrementally.

---

# 15. Interview Points

### What is SDLC?

SDLC is a standard process used in the software industry to plan, design, develop, test, and deploy high-quality software products.

### Main Phases of SDLC

1. Planning
2. Requirement Definition
3. Design
4. Build/Development
5. Testing
6. Deployment

### Which SDLC Phases Are Most Important for DevOps?

* Build
* Testing
* Deployment

### What Does a DevOps Engineer Do?

A DevOps engineer automates the build, testing, and deployment processes to improve efficiency, reduce manual effort, and deliver software faster.

# Quick Revision


SDLC = Software Development Life Cycle

Goal:
Deliver High-Quality Software

Phases:
Planning
→ Requirements
→ Design (HLD + LLD)
→ Build
→ Test
→ Deploy

DevOps Focus:
Build + Test + Deploy Automation

Result:
Faster Delivery
Higher Efficiency
Better Quality
```

**Key Takeaway:** SDLC is the standard workflow followed by software companies, and DevOps improves SDLC by automating the Build, Test, and Deployment stages.
